        Ansible failed to complete successfully. Any error output should be
        visible above. Please fix these errors and try again.
      fabric_app_not_found: |-
        The "fab" program could not be found! Please verify
        that "fab" is available on the PATH of your host
        system, and try again.

        If you haven't installed Fabric yet, please install Fabric
        on your system. Vagrant can't do this for you in a safe, automated
        way. Please see fabfile.org for more info.
